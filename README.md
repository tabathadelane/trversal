### <a href="http://trversal.com">Trversal.com</a> is an itenerary building web application.  
This app dynamically interacts with Google Maps to calculate the most up to date travel times between your selected locations. Start a trip and add the points of interest you would like to see each day. The app will keep track of the time needed throughout the day to travel between each place so you can realistically see how much you can fit into your trip and stay on schedule!
